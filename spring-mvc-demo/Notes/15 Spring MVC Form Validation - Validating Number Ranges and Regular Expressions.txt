Spring MVC Form Validation - Validating Number Ranges and Regular Expressions.

	Lecture 153 to 161
	1.@Min,@Max validation for any field by providing the value. And if you are sending null value then use wrapper class because we have implemented the @InitBinder which will trim data you sending null or nothing it will bind ans show proper message that it is invalid number(this is custom message we are providing by using @NotNull annotation).
	2.@Pattern by using this annotation you can define which type of value you can pass into the field and how much it's length will be.
	3.If you are sending string value in integer field then for showing custom message we have created folder resources inside src folder and given custom message for typeMismatch. And loaded the file in servlet xml by adding the springclass which handle this type of validation(typeMismatch).
	4. All the error key is generated by the spring for providing error message so we can use that same key and provide our custom message instead of java message (typeMismatch.customer.freePasses)
