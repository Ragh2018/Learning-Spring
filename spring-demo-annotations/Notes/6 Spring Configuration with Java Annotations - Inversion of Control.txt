		Java Annotations
		1. Special labels/markers added to java classes.
		2. Provide meta-data about the class.
		3. Processed at compile time or run-time for special processing.
		
		Why Spring Configuration with Annotations?
		1. XML configuration can be verbose
		2.Configure your spring bean with annotations.
		3.Annotations minimize the xml configuration.
		
		Scanning for Component classes.
		1. Spring will scan your java classes for special annotations.
		2. Automatically register the beans in the spring container.
		
		@Component("beanId")
		
		By default if you didn't mention the beanId then it will take class Name as a default beanId with first letter lowercase.
